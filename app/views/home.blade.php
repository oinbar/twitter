	<h4>What we do:</h4>
	<p>We, at Up2Data, collect time sensitive data across the social web and draw ongoing mission-critical insights tailored to your organization.</p><br>

	<h4>How we do it:</h4>

	<h5>1. UNDERSTAND</h5>
		<p>Our team of software engineers, data scientists and business analysts get together with the people who drive your organization. Together 
		we shed light on your strategic needs, as we build context and parametrize the problem. <p>

	<h5>2. MODEL</h5>
	 <p>We design an analytical model and an underlying data collection engine. The result is a big data system geared towards answering your specific,
	 	goal driven questions.

	<h5>3. COLLECT</h5>
	<p>We use open source and propietary big data technologies to crawl sites such as twitter, facebook, university newspapers and other sources
	in order to consrtruct a comprehensive picture of the people and events that comprise your social arena.<p>

	<h5>4. ANALYZE</h5>
	<p>We normalize, mash up, and combine the data into a uniform database. We then use techniques from social network analysis, natural language processing, 
	machine learning, and some good old common sense to derive meaning from the data. We discover influencial individuals, predict future events, uncover 
	trends and explain behaviors, all in a way that allows your organization to maximize its efforts.<p>

	<h5>5. REPORT & ALERT</h5>
	<p>Once the first batch of data is in and fully analyzed, we deliver an intuitive report that allows you to act on our insights.
	More importantly, by this point we have a built a full data collection and analysis platform that is speficially tailored to your needs, and capable of
	delivering those same insights in real time. The models all update based on incoming data, and we chime in every once in a while
	to give our own interpretation in a fresh report.<p>
